## Discrete implementation of the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition

__These scripts are an example of solving the Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition on a two-dimensional vector field.__

## Basics

Let **u** be a 2D vector field,

**u** = grad Ï† + rot Ïˆ + **h**

**u** = âˆ‡Ï† + âˆ‡ Ã— Ïˆ + **h**

where,

âˆ‡Ï† = (âˆ‚x Ï†, âˆ‚y Ï†),

âˆ‡ Ã— Ïˆ = (âˆ‚y Ïˆ, -âˆ‚x Ïˆ),

âˆ‡ Ã— **h** = âˆ‡â‹…**h** = 0.

We solve for Ïˆ and Ï† given by,

âˆ‡â‹…âˆ‡ Ï† = âˆ‡ â‹… **u**

âˆ‡â‹…âˆ‡ Ïˆ = -âˆ‡â‹…**J** **u**

**h** = **u** - âˆ‡Ï† - âˆ‡ Ã— Ïˆ

where **J** is rotation by Ï€/2,

```
J = [0 -1]
    [1  0]
```

## Approach 1

There are a couple of different approaches for finding Ï† and Ïˆ. Here, I follow *Harsh Bhatia et al*.

The idea is to incorporate open-flow boundary conditions in a *natural way*, whatever that means.

This accomplished by "solving" for Ï† and Ïˆ by putting âˆ‡â‹…âˆ‡ on the other side of the equality as âˆ« _g_ â‹… dÎ©,

Ï†(**xo**) = âˆ« _g_ âˆ‡ â‹… **u** dÎ©

Ïˆ(**xo**) = - âˆ« _g_ âˆ‡â‹…**J** **u** dÎ©

where g is the Green function that solves the Laplace equation on Î© with a source at **xo**.

**Note:** I am not entirely sure the boundaries are well recovered. I should check that.

All these implement this idea:
```
hhd_simple.m (60 seconds)
hhd_cool.m   (60 seconds)
hhd_cooler.m the integral operator is coded in Fortran-Mex (no speed-up ðŸ˜¢)
hhd_faster.m the integral operator is stored in memory (0.01 seconds but lots of memory)
``` 

## Approach 2

Discretize the operator âˆ‡â‹…âˆ‡ and solve for:

âˆ‡â‹…âˆ‡ Ï† = âˆ‡ â‹… **u**

âˆ‡â‹…âˆ‡ Ïˆ = -âˆ‡â‹…**J** **u**

This one implements this idea,
```
hhd_fast.m (0.5 seconds, light on memory)
```
The Laplacian operator is built using the *alles/projects/graph-alg/mesher/* project.
