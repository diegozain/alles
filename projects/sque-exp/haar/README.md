# Haar wavelet compression

## Given a pic, compress it using Haar wavelets.

2d Haar wavelets are rectangle thingies that tile the plane.

__These scripts are examples of the Haar wavelet decomposition.__

This whole project is from [this great](https://userpages.umbc.edu/~rostamia/cbook/) book.

## Haar transform (no pics)

In the terminal:

```bash
make
make clean
./haar-test
```

This should convince you the Haar transform code is good.

## Haar transform on pictures

Under construction.
