* Go to ```/gallery``` to see nice pictures ([link](gallery/)).
* Go to ```/projects``` to run projects.

If running Matlab projects, please set paths first by running the script:

```dir_paths.m```

Some are written in Matlab, some use Python packages.
Some were written by me, some are a collage of stuff taken from the iternet.
Most are proof of concept by example. 

__Not all are perfect but they all work.__
